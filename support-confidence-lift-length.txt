In data mining and warehousing, support is a measure of the frequency of occurrence of an itemset in a dataset. Confidence is a measure of the strength of the relationship between two items in an itemset. Lift is a measure of the "interestingness" of an association rule, which is defined as the ratio of the observed support of the itemset to the expected support if the items were independent.

Length refers to the number of items in an itemset. For example, if an itemset is {A, B, C}, then the length of the itemset is 3.

Support confidence lift and length are often used in association rule mining, which is a technique used to discover relationships between variables in a large dataset. These measures can be used to identify patterns in the data and to generate rules that can be used to make predictions or take other actions based on the data.
